A terminal-based application was developed to aid visitors from Mars in pinpointing their precious cargo concealed along their terrestrial journey. Faced with the need for spare parts to mend their malfunctioning spacecraft, the Martians strategically buried their cargo within three containers of diverse sizes along a 7-kilometer trajectory leading to the nearest urban center. The combined weight of the cargo amounted to 713 kilograms, and it was cunningly concealed with markers denoting both distance and weight.

This program employs one-dimensional arrays to register kilometer markers, potentially revealing the location of the cargo. However, here's the intriguing twist - the boxes are equipped with appendages resembling tentacles that autonomously shift them to new covert positions if the initially input kilometer markers prove inaccurate. The program systematically solicits users for three markers in succession, validating the presence of cargo at each specified point. Should the cumulative weight of the discovered boxes fail to reach the specified 713 kilograms, the process iterates until the accurate markers are entered, ensuring the successful recovery of the Martian cargo.

During the execution of this task, I acquired valuable insights:

One-dimensional arrays: Implemented arrays for the systematic storage and administration of cargo box weights and locations.

Conditional structures and loops: Applied conditional statements and loop constructs to validate user inputs, ascertain cargo presence, and orchestrate the dynamic movements of the cargo boxes.

Git proficiency: Developed a solid understanding of fundamental Git operations, encompassing 'git add' for staging changes, 'git commit' for documenting alterations with informative messages, and 'git push' for transmitting modifications to the remote GitHub repository.

GitHub navigation: Familiarized myself with the process of establishing a remote repository through GitHub's user interface, and honed skills in monitoring issues for streamlined project management.


Technological tools employed:

Random module: Leveraged the Python standard library's random module to dynamically generate varied box locations for the cargo, enhancing the unpredictability of the cargo's placement.

Git proficiency: Oversaw the project's version control system, proficiently navigating through the tracking of changes, ensuring meticulous management of modifications and updates to the project.
